      <p>INSTRUCTIONS TO DISCOVER</p>
      <p>THE FIGURES IN STAINED GLASS!</p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <p class="indent">Eight stained-glass windows on the sides of Our Savior Lutheran Church (OSLC) combine color and deeply meaningful art to show the message of the Apostles' Creed.  Each window is shown here with two drawings and a color photo, by which you can discover the figures and symbols in that window.</p>
    <br>
    <ol type="1" class="">
      <li>Scroll to the page with the Window you wish to explore. Read the description.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Locate the figures in the drawing that has titles on it.</li>
     <br>
      <li>Locate the same figures in the drawing without titles.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Go to the corresponding window page that has the two drawings plus the colored picture. To do this, click on any drawing. To return, click on any drawing again. (Does not apply to Jerusalem Cross Window above the altar.) </li>
      <br>
      <li>Locate the figures in the colored picture. This can be challenging because a single figure may have several colors of glass.</li>
      <br>
      <li>Visit Our Savior Lutheran Church and find the figures in the 15’ stained glass windows.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>It is much easier to first find figures in the drawings because the many colors of the glass make them hard to see. Some are partial figures that your mind's eye will complete. Also, the Creation Window is the most difficult, so we suggest you do it last.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Because the figures are not immediately obvious, they invite your contemplation and discovery. There is much to discover.</p>

      <p>GENERAL INFORMATION</p>
      <br>
    </div>
    <p class="indent">Nine large stained glass windows adorn the sanctuary of
      Our Savior Lutheran Church. The round Jerusalem Cross
      Window stands over the altar. Eight long windows depicting
      the phrases of the Apostles' Creed wrap around the side walls of
      the sanctuary, beginning on the right-hand side near the pulpit.
      The Creation, Holy Birth, Crucifixion, and Resurrection
      windows line the right wall from the front of the sanctuary to
      the back. Continuing the Creed on the left wall, the Ascension,
      Holy Spirit, Church, and Life Everlasting windows line the wall
      from the back of the sanctuary to the front.</p>
    <p class="indent">The art in stained glass windows has been used for centuries
      to teach God's people, especially in the ages when few people
      could read. Symbols that people recognize can present an entire
      concept in a small figure. These beautiful windows were
      installed for the dedication of Our Savior Lutheran Church on
      September 16, 1990. The art presented in their brilliant colors
      gives a comprehensive message of Christianity and invites the
      viewer to meditate on that message.</p>
    <p class="indent">The theme of the round Jerusalem Cross Window is Christ's
      command to spread the Gospel from Jerusalem to the ends of
      the Earth. (Acts 1:8). The Jerusalem Cross was chosen as the
      symbol of Our Savior Lutheran Church and is found not only in
      this window, but elsewhere in the sanctuary.</p>
    <p class="indent">
      The theme of the eight long windows is the Apostles'
      Creed, with each window illustrating a portion of the Creed.
      The symbolic number 40 is represented in the border
      rectangular pieces. The inside border work is broken into 66
      pieces to represent the 66 books of the Bible. Each of the eight
      windows incorporates the Jerusalem Cross in the bottom
      section. Inside each cross is a symbol that relates to the
      illustrated theme above.</p>
    <p class="indent justifylast">
      The Apostles' Creed Windows are a mix of traditional and
      modern. Tradition is seen in the borders of the windows and in
      Christian symbols that date back to the early church. Symbols</p>

    <p>are found in the lower part of each window, as well as other parts of some windows. Modern is seen in the abstract figures telling the story of each window in the middle and upper parts.</p>
    <p class="indent">The windows draw the viewer into action to find animals, people, and angels that are hidden in the colors. Some figures and symbols are only partially visible in the windows. The eye of the viewer must fill in the rest.</p>
    <p class=indent>Some of the symbols in these windows are:</p>

    <p class=indent>Dennis Roberts is a member of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod and founder of ISH Stuidos in Fredericksburg, Texas. His works are found mostly in churches, but also in hospitals and other buildings around the nation. Of particular note are five stained glass windows that beautify the 9/11 Memorial Chapel of the Pentagon in Washington, DC.</p>

      <p>The central theme of the window is the Jerusalem Cross illustrated by the cross itself. The theme is further emphasized by designs in each of the four quadrants that illustrate scriptures referring to Jerusalem. The window is 8 feet 4 inches in diameter.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="bold">THE JERUSALEM CROSS</p>
      <p>The cross has four small crosses between the arms, the five crosses symbolizing the five wounds of our Lord. The red is to symbolize Christ shedding his blood, gold his kingship, green the hope we have in Christ, and the clear glass on the inside that extends past the ends of the cross represents Christ's victory and resurrection.</p>

    <p>An Angel of the Lord appears to shepherds, announcing the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. <span class=italic>(Luke 2:8-14).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shepherd Staffs represent the lowly shepherds.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The Manger scene represents the humility into which Jesus was born. <span class=italic>(Luke 2:7).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The descending dove over the Manger symbolizes his conception by the Holy Spirit. <span class=italic>(Matthew 1:20).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking at the Manger are the heads of a Donkey and an Ox, animals used for service.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Below the Manger appear the Gifts brought by the Wise Men&mdash;gold, frankincense, and myrrh. <span class=italic>(Matthew 2:11).</span>&nbsp;As the promise and the Word take root in our hearts, we are moved to respond with our gifts.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The Palm Fronds at the top reflect the Lord's triumphant entry into Jerusalem. <span class=italic>(John 12:12-13).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The basin of Water and Towel were used when Pilate washed his hands after sentencing Christ to die. <span class=italic>(Matthew 27:24).</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>In the center is Christ on the Cross (viewed from the side), silhouetted against the Crown of Thorns. <span class=italic>(Matthew 27:29).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;At the base of the cross is Christ's red Robe, and the Three Dice used to cast lots for it. <span class=italic>(John 19:23-24).</span></p>

    <br>
    <p>This window "reads" from the bottom to the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;It begins with the head of a dragon, the symbol of Satan.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon, with jaws wide open, leaps desperately from the flames of Hell to catch the rising Phoenix. <span class=italic>(1 John 3:8; Revelation 12).</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>The Phoneix Bird, legendary though it was, appeared as a symbol in the early church and stood for the bodily resurrection&mdash;first for our victorious, risen Lord, and then for all believers. <span class=italic>(John 11:25-26; John 14:19).</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>Above the Phoenix are the Women entering the Empty Tomb, to find that Christ has risen. <span class=italic>(Luke 24:1-3).</span></p>
    <br>
    <p>JERUSALEM CROSS SYMBOL</p>

    <br>
    <p>The ascended Christ is at the right side of a Symbol for God the Father (the "all-seeing eye"). <span class=italic>(Mark 16:19, Acts 7:55).</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;The all-seeing eye represents the all-knowing and ever-present God, who surveys all creation and holds the whole world in his hand.

    <p>JERUSALEM CROSS SYMBOL</p>

    <br>
    <p>Below the Dove are a Prophet's Scroll, a symbol of the prophets who spoke god's truth <span class=italic>(Acts 3:21; James 5:10),</span> and the Flames of Pentecost <span class=italic>(Acts 2:3-4)</span> to remind us of the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives.</p>

    <p>JERUSALEM CROSS SYMBOL</p>
    <p>The Descending Dove with the three-rayed nimbus indicates that the Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Trinity.&nbsp;&nbsp;The descending dove was present at the Lord's baptism. <span class=italic>(Luke 3:21-22).</span></p>

    <p class="center bold">DESIGNING AND FABRICATING THE WINDOWS</p>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">Dennis Roberts, founder of IHS Studios, was commissioned in 1989 by the building committee of Our Savior Lutheran Church to design and craft stained glass windows for the church's new sanctuary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge was to create windows that incorporated both traditional elements and modern designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Roberts used traditional elements in the borders of the windows and the symbols at the bottom of each long window.&nbsp;&nbsp;He used modern abstract figures to tell the story in each window.&nbsp;&nbsp;His designs incorporated the Jerusalem Cross, which is the symbol for this congregation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine beautiful windows were installed for the dedication of Our Savior Lutheran Church on September 16, 1990.</p>
    <p class="indent">Roberts previously had designed several windows for other churches.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, the IHS Studios was in his Houston home and consisted of his garage, which had been converted into a fabrication room, and a studio built above it.&nbsp;&nbsp;He had two full time employees and one part time.</p>
    <p class="indent">Today, in 2005, Roberts creates his windows with computer technology; in 1989 he did all the artwork by hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary designs were hand drawn, as were the "cartoons"—the life size renditions of the designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The round Jerusalem Window is over 8 feet in diameter, and the long windows are almost 15 feet tall.&nbsp;&nbsp;To make sure that the many shapes and lead lines were placed correctly, Roberts had to get far enough away from the cartoons to be able to see any inaccuracies.&nbsp;&nbsp;He needed a large space and a ten-foot ladder.&nbsp;&nbsp;He laid the cartoons out on the floor of the fellowship hall of his church in Houston, climbed the ladder to view them, and made corrections as needed.</p>
    <p class="indent">Mouth-blown, antique glass, which has little bubbles in it that catch the light in unique ways, provides the brilliant colors in the windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the morning sun shines through, those same colors dance across the sanctuary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The glass was made by Desag, a German company that makes uncommonly beautiful glass.</p>
    <p class="indent">There is some difference between the drawings of the windows and the windows as a finished work of art.&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary drawings were made from building plan measurements.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as is often the case, the final actual measurements of the windows were different.&nbsp;&nbsp;The space between the top panel and the arch of the long windows turned out to be wider than anticipated, and the stained glass designs were altered to fit.</p>

    <p class="center bold">DENNIS ROBERTS, Artist</p>
    <br>
    <p class="indent">"It is God's glory -- not mine," Mr. Roberts said of his talents. "It's His gift."</p>
    <p class="indent">Before Dennis Roberts began his career in ecclesiastical arts, he served as a Marine, and then as director of international sales and marketing at Pan American Airlines. He was very active in Christ Lutheran Church in Houston, Texas, and was an eager student of the Bible. During that time he painted in oils and watercolors, "but not enough to put two children through college." His interest in stained glass windows grew. When Pan Am shut its doors in 1982, Roberts started IHS Studios. In the early days of the studio, he gained experience by creating stained glass windows for new sanctuaries of Lutheran churches that the Texas District LCMS started as mission churches. Roberts provided the windows at no cost. He continues that ministry today.</p>
    <p class="indent">In 1992 Roberts moved IHS Studios to Fredericksburg, Texas, where he and his wife, Linda, are active members of Resurrection Lutheran Church. Robert's goal was to create a studio that would use God-given talents in the creation of works that would glorify and honor God. He uses a creative mix of traditional symbolism and contemporary design elements that harmonize with the architecture in which they exist. He has gathered Artists and Craftsmen who together under his supervision have completed over 800 commissions. Most of these are for churches, but in the fall of 2001, Roberts was asked to design and fabricate a Dalle de Verre window for the 9/11 Memorial Chapel in the Pentagon in Washington D.C. In 2003 he was asked to do four additional windows. Roberts made the Pentagon windows as a gift to the nation. Since then his works include projects for hospitals and other public settings, such as Fort Hood in Killeen and Camp Mabry in Austin.</p>
    <p class="indent">"God pushed me in the right direction," Roberts said. "Sometimes we have more free work than paid work, but you cannot outgive God."</p>
